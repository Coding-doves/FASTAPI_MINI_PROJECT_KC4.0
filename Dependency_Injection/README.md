# DEPENDENCT INJECTION PROJECTS
___
1. Dependency Injected Calculator API:

Create a simple calculator API where arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) are performed using dependency-injected functions.


2. Configurable Greeting API:

Build an API that returns a greeting message. Use dependencies to inject different greeting messages based on the time of day
 

3. Configurable Feature Flags API:

Build an API that uses feature flags to enable or disable features. Use dependencies to inject the current state of feature flags into your endpoints.
 

4. Third-Party API Integration:

Build an API that integrates with a third-party service (e.g., weather API). Use dependencies to handle the setup and configuration of the third-party client.
